**Output Format Rules:**
1. Extract every ingredient from the recipe.
2. Convert recipe-style measurements (e.g., teaspoons, tablespoons, pinches, cups) into practical purchase quantities and units (e.g., grams, kilograms, liters, milliliters, whole items, packs).
3. If an ingredient appears more than once, sum the total and express it in a single purchase quantity.
4. Use reasonable store-buyable amounts (round up to the nearest standard pack size or whole number if necessary).
5. List each ingredient on a new line, preceded by a bullet point (`*`), with the quantity in the format:  
   `* Ingredient — Quantity Unit`  
   (e.g., `* Flour — 500 g`, `* Eggs — 12 pcs`, `* Milk — 1 L`)
6. Do not include any other text, headers, or explanations.
